# A time traveler has suddenly appeared in your classroom!

# Create a variable representing the traveler's
# year of origin (e.g., year = 2000)
# and greet our strange visitor with a different message
# if he is from the distant past (before 1900),
# the present era (1900-2020) or from the far future (beyond 2020).

year = int(input("Greetings! What is your year of origin? "))  # Fixed input syntax

if year <= 1900:  # Added missing colon
    print("Woah, that's the past!")
elif year > 1900 and year < 2020:  # Replaced '&&' with 'and'
    print("That's totally the present!")
else:  # Replaced incorrect 'elif:' with 'else'
    print("Far out, that's the future!!")
